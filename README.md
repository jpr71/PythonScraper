PythonScraper
=============

This was part of EECS 395, where we worked with IBM's Watson to develop an artificially intelligent Course Adviser.
This was the scraper used to collect data from some of Northwestern's academic departments.
Uses Beautiful Soup.
All files are similar but their paths are different so I had to modify them accordingly
